            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <p>My goal is to earn a job as a junior developer once i graduate from Coding Temple. Once I have my foot in the door, I would like to see just how far i can climb, and never stop learning new skills and fine tuning old ones.<br> What initially led to my interest in coding was an article I read about how our entire financial system still mainly runs on COBOL, and it's reached the point where fewer than a thousand people actually have the skills to maintain it. I knew that was a reach, but my goal was, and still is, to one day be one of the people with those skills.</p>

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>Ah jeez, Rick. This is the part that really gets long winded. I've already mentioned my passion for coding and all things software, so no need to touch on that further. I love to cook, at one point I wanted to be a professional Chef. And while I may not be that, I can still throw down in the kitchen. I'm also an accomplished archer, and at one point in my life was ranked in the top ten for my age bracket in New York State. I still dabble in skateboarding, although I'm nowhere near as good as i was in my teens. Boardsports in general really, the only thing keeping me from spending every free second strapped to my snowboard on the mountain would be that I currently reside in Florida (but I'm looking into surfing next!). I'm also an avid gamer, musician, and very obsessed with film and cinema. I love to read and write, it's pretty rare that you catch me without my nose buried in a book, journal, or screen! It's really hard for me to nail down one interest, without rambling or trailing off into another. I guess if I had to keep it short, I'd say that if it seems interesting to me odds are I'll throw some time into it and see for myself!</p>
